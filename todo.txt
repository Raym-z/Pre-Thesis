1. Implement Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics
What’s involved:
Add precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and possibly EER to your evaluation.
You already use classification_report, confusion_matrix, and roc_auc_score in your ViT code.
You just need to add these to your ResNet evaluation and make sure results are clearly printed/saved.
Difficulty:

1. Implement Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics

You already use classification_report, confusion_matrix, and roc_auc_score in your ViT code.
You just need to add these to your ResNet evaluation and make sure results are clearly printed/saved.
Difficulty:
Easy (1-2 hours)
You already have most of the code and libraries in place.

2. Add Interpretability Analysis (Grad-CAM, Attention Maps)
What’s involved:
For ResNet: Use a library like torchcam or pytorch-grad-cam to generate Grad-CAM visualizations.
For ViT: Visualize attention maps (can use vit-explain or similar, or extract attention weights manually).
Display or save the resulting heatmaps for sample images.
Difficulty:
Moderate (2-4 hours for basic Grad-CAM on ResNet, a bit more for ViT attention maps if you want pretty visualizations)
Grad-CAM for ResNet is well-documented and can be done quickly.
ViT attention visualization is a bit trickier but there are open-source scripts.

3. Intensity-Aware Analysis
What’s involved:
Your stylized images have intensity in the filename (e.g., 150, 300, 500, 700).
Parse this value and add it as a column in your manifest or extract it on the fly.
Analyze detection accuracy as a function of intensity (e.g., plot accuracy vs. intensity).
Difficulty:
Easy (1-2 hours)
Just a bit of data wrangling and plotting.

4. Basic Ensemble Methods
What’s involved:
Load both ResNet and ViT models.
For each image, get predictions from both and combine (e.g., majority vote or average probabilities).
Evaluate ensemble performance using the same metrics as above.
Difficulty:
Moderate (2-3 hours)
Straightforward if both models are trained and saved.
Some care needed to ensure both models use the same preprocessing and device.
